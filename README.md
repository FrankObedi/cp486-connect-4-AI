# AI Project : Connect Four

## Overview 
Connect 4 is a classic vertical board game. Players take turns dropping tokens into columns which fall down to the lowest point in that column. A player can win by either getting 4 in a row, 4 in a column, or 4 in a diagonal.

In this project we developed an AI program that plays this game, achieving unbeatable performance through the implementation of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
